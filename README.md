## What is this?

This is a demo project showing how to host and develop [ExcaliburJS](https://excaliburjs.com/docs/) games on a NextJS site.

## Breakout

[Breakout](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakout_(video_game)>) is an old game from 1976 and serves as the "Hello World" [project](https://excaliburjs.com/docs/getting-started) for ExcaliburJS.

## Breakout UI

The Breakout HelloWorld does not have any UI elements to go with it and it is not obvious to an _Excalibur_ newcomer how to implement UI that can hook into the game loop and game state. This sample code is intended to provide an example of how to do that using commonplace React JSX. A SolidJS version of this will be forthcoming soon.

## Getting Started

Clone the repo, run

```
npm i
```

then run

```
npm run dev
```
